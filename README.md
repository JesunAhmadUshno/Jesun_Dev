## 💎 Overview
This portfolio is a serverless **Single Page Application (SPA)** designed to showcase the intersection of Data Engineering and Creative Development. Beyond a traditional landing page, it serves as a live demonstration of Generative AI integration, featuring a grounded AI twin and real-time architectural tools.

Built with a focus on speed and aesthetic, the application leverages the **Gemini API** to provide an interactive narrative of my professional journey at KPMG and academic research in Canada.

## 🚀 Features
* **🧠 Jesun.AI Twin:** A context-grounded RAG-lite chatbot trained on my professional history to provide instant, accurate answers to recruiters.
* **✨ Vibe Generator:** An AI-powered design architect that suggests tech stacks and aesthetic directions based on user project ideas.
* **⚡ Smart Carousel:** A custom text engine that dynamically adjusts display timing based on content length for optimal readability.
* **🎨 Spotlight UI:** High-performance cursor tracking for dynamic lighting effects on project cards.
* **📱 Responsive Flux:** A mobile-first design system built on Tailwind CSS for seamless viewing across all devices.
